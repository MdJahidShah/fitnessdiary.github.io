    <h2>The Role of Prescription Medication</h2>
    <p>Prescription medications are often used to help manage osteoarthritis symptoms. These medications can reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve joint function.</p>

    <h2>Types of Prescription Medications for Osteoarthritis</h2>

    <h3>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)</h3>
    <p>NSAIDs are commonly prescribed to reduce pain and inflammation. Examples include ibuprofen and naproxen. They work by blocking the enzymes that cause inflammation.</p>
    
    <h4>Benefits of NSAIDs</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces pain and inflammation</li>
        <li>Improves joint function</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Potential Side Effects of NSAIDs</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Stomach pain</li>
        <li>Heartburn</li>
        <li>Ulcers</li>
        <li>Increased risk of heart problems</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Acetaminophen</h3>
    <p>Acetaminophen is another medication that can help with osteoarthritis pain. It's not an anti-inflammatory, but it can reduce pain and fever.</p>
    
    <h4>Benefits of Acetaminophen</h4>

        <li>Reduces pain</li>
        <li>Fewer side effects compared to NSAIDs</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Liver damage (if taken in large amounts)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>COX-2 Inhibitors</h3>
    <p>COX-2 inhibitors are a type of NSAID that specifically targets the COX-2 enzyme, which causes inflammation. Celecoxib is a common COX-2 inhibitor used for osteoarthritis.</p>
    
    <h4>Benefits of COX-2 Inhibitors</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces pain and inflammation</li>
        <li>Less stomach irritation compared to regular NSAIDs</li>

        <li>High blood pressure</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Opioids</h3>
    <p>Opioids are strong pain medications used for severe osteoarthritis pain. They should be used with caution due to their risk of addiction and side effects. Examples include tramadol and oxycodone.</p>
    
    <h4>Benefits of Opioids</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces severe pain</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Potential Side Effects of Opioids</h4>
